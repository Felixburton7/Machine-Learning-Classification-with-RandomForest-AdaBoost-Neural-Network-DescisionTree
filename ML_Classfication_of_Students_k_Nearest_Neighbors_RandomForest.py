## **1. Setup and Data Loading**

### **Mount Google Drive (Optional)**

If you're using Google Colab and need to access files from your Google Drive, uncomment and use the following code. Otherwise, since we're downloading the data directly, this step can be skipped.

```python
# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### **Import Libraries**

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

import lightgbm as lgb

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

### **Download and Load Data**

```python
def download_file(url, file_name):
    """Download a file from a URL."""
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)

# URLs for the datasets
train_url = 'https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse416/23sp/homeworks/hw5/edx_train.csv'
test_url = 'https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse416/23sp/homeworks/hw5/edx_test.csv'

# Download the datasets
download_file(train_url, 'edx_train.csv')
download_file(test_url, 'edx_test.csv')

# Load datasets
df_train = pd.read_csv('edx_train.csv')
df_test = pd.read_csv('edx_test.csv')
```

## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Before diving into modeling, it's essential to understand the data.

```python
# Display first few rows of the training data
df_train.head()
```

```python
# Check for missing values
print("Missing values in training data:\n", df_train.isnull().sum())
print("\nMissing values in test data:\n", df_test.isnull().sum())
```

```python
# Distribution of the target variable
sns.countplot(x='certified', data=df_train)
plt.title('Distribution of Certified vs. Not Certified')
plt.show()
```

## **3. Data Preprocessing**

### **Feature Selection**

Select relevant features for modeling.

```python
features = [
    'course_id', 'registered', 'viewed', 'explored', 'final_cc_cname_DI',
    'LoE_DI', 'YoB', 'gender', 'start_time_DI', 'last_event_DI',
    'nevents', 'ndays_act', 'nplay_video', 'nchapters', 'nforum_posts'
]
target = 'certified'

df_train = df_train[features + [target]]
df_test = df_test[features + ['userid_DI']]
```

### **Handling Categorical Variables**

Convert categorical variables into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.

```python
# Combine train and test for consistent encoding
combined = pd.concat([df_train, df_test], sort=False)

# One-Hot Encode categorical variables
combined = pd.get_dummies(combined, columns=['final_cc_cname_DI', 'LoE_DI', 'gender', 'start_time_DI', 'last_event_DI'], drop_first=True)

# Split back into train and test
df_train = combined[combined[target].notna()]
df_test = combined[combined[target].isna()].drop(columns=[target])
```

### **Handling Missing Values**

Use `SimpleImputer` to handle missing values.

```python
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')

# Fit on training data
df_train[features] = imputer.fit_transform(df_train[features])

# Transform test data
df_test[features] = imputer.transform(df_test[features])
```

### **Feature Scaling**

Standardize numerical features to improve model performance.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Identify numerical features
numerical_features = ['registered', 'viewed', 'explored', 'YoB', 'nevents', 'ndays_act', 'nplay_video', 'nchapters', 'nforum_posts']

# Fit scaler on training data
df_train[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(df_train[numerical_features])

# Transform test data
df_test[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(df_test[numerical_features])
```

## **4. Model Training and Evaluation**

### **4.1 Dummy Classifier**

A baseline model that predicts uniformly at random.

```python

dummy_model.fit(df_train.drop(target, axis=1), df_train[target])

# Predictions
dummy_predictions = dummy_model.predict(df_test)

# Save predictions
submission_dummy = pd.DataFrame({
    'userid_DI': df_test['userid_DI'],
    'certified': dummy_predictions
})

disp_lgbm.plot(cmap='Oranges')
plt.title(f'LightGBM Confusion Matrix (Accuracy: {lgbm_accuracy:.2f})')
plt.show()
```

### **4.5 Neural Network Classifier**

```

## **5. Generating Submission**

Assuming LightGBM performed the best based on validation accuracy, we'll use it to generate the final submission.

```python
# Retrain LightGBM on the entire training data
lgbm_final = lgb.LGBMClassifier(
    boosting_type='gbdt',
    objective='binary',
    num_class=1,
    metric='binary_logloss',
    num_leaves=31,

    feature_fraction=0.9,
    bagging_fraction=0.8,
    bagging_freq=5,
    verbose=-1,
    random_state=42
)

lgbm_final.fit(X, y, eval_set=[(X, y)], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose=False)

# Predictions on test set
test_predictions = lgbm_final.predict(df_test.drop('userid_DI', axis=1))

# Create submission DataFrame
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'userid_DI': df_test['userid_DI'],
    'certified': test_predictions
})

# Save to CSV
submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
print("Submission file 'submission.csv' created successfully.")
```

## **6. Discussion**

### **6.1 Training the Models [7 Points]**

**Models Explored:**

1. **Dummy Classifier:** Served as a baseline to understand the minimum performance expected without any learning.
2. **Decision Tree:** Simple yet powerful for capturing non-linear relationships. Initially set with `max_depth=4` to prevent overfitting.
3. **Random Forest:** An ensemble of Decision Trees, enhancing performance and generalization. Utilized Grid Search to find optimal hyperparameters.
4. **LightGBM:** A gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and performance. Tuned parameters like `learning_rate`, `num_leaves`, and `bagging_fraction` to improve accuracy.
5. **Neural Network (MLPClassifier):** Explored due to its capability to capture complex patterns, though it required careful tuning to prevent overfitting.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

- **Decision Tree:** Adjusted `max_depth` to control model complexity and prevent overfitting.
- **Random Forest:** Utilized Grid Search to explore combinations of `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`. Found that a higher number of trees with deeper depths improved accuracy.
- **LightGBM:** Tuned `learning_rate`, `num_leaves`, and `bagging_fraction` to balance bias-variance trade-off, leading to enhanced performance.
- **Neural Network:** Experimented with the number of hidden layers and neurons, activation functions, and learning rates to achieve optimal convergence.

**Visualization Insights:**

Confusion matrices revealed that while some models achieved high overall accuracy, they varied in their ability to correctly predict each class. For instance, the Decision Tree showed high accuracy but might have struggled with certain classes, whereas ensemble methods like Random Forest and LightGBM provided more balanced performance across classes.

### **6.2 Feature Selection [3 Points]**

**Features Used:**

- **Numerical Features:** `registered`, `viewed`, `explored`, `YoB`, `nevents`, `ndays_act`, `nplay_video`, `nchapters`, `nforum_posts`
- **Categorical Features:** `course_id`, `final_cc_cname_DI`, `LoE_DI`, `gender`, `start_time_DI`, `last_event_DI`

**Transformations Applied:**

- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converted categorical variables into numerical format to allow models to interpret them effectively.
- **Scaling:** Standardized numerical features to ensure that models like Neural Networks converged efficiently.

**Important Features:**

While initial feature selection indicated that `viewed` and `explored` were crucial (aligning with the intuition that student engagement metrics strongly influence certification outcomes), the best-performing models utilized all available features. This suggests that a combination of engagement metrics, demographic information, and course-specific variables collectively contribute to the prediction accuracy.

### **6.3 Ethical Implications [5 Points]**

Deploying predictive models in educational settings carries significant ethical considerations:

1. **Bias and Fairness:** If the training data contains inherent biases (e.g., underrepresentation of certain demographic groups), the model may perpetuate or even exacerbate these biases. For instance, students from marginalized backgrounds might be unfairly predicted as less likely to complete courses, leading to reduced support or resources for these groups.

2. **Transparency:** Students should be informed about how their data is being used. Lack of transparency can erode trust and may lead to concerns about privacy and data security.

3. **Autonomy:** Relying heavily on model predictions to tailor educational materials might limit personalized learning experiences. It's essential to ensure that such models enhance rather than constrain educational opportunities.

4. **Accountability:** Clear guidelines must be established regarding who is responsible for the outcomes influenced by the model. Misuse or overreliance on predictions without human oversight can lead to unintended negative consequences.

5. **Data Privacy:** Ensuring the confidentiality and security of student data is paramount. Unauthorized access or breaches can have severe implications for individuals' privacy.

6. **Economic Disparities:** Models predicting student success might influence funding or resource allocation, potentially widening gaps between different student groups if not carefully managed.

Before implementing such models, it's crucial to conduct thorough bias assessments, involve diverse stakeholders in the development process, and establish robust ethical guidelines to ensure that the deployment benefits all students equitably.
